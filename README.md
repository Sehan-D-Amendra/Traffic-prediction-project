# Traffic-prediction-project

Implemented a machine learning-based solution to predict traffic volume and type using diverse inputs such as holiday status, calendar date, time, weather type, and weather description. This project is designed to help commuters, city planners, and traffic management systems anticipate and manage traffic flow efficiently.

**Technologies/Tools Used:**

- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS

**Outcomes:**

Achieved accurate predictions of traffic volume and type, enhancing the ability to forecast traffic conditions and make data-driven decisions for traffic management and planning.

**Additional Details:**

The project leveraged a dataset from Kaggle, incorporating historical traffic and weather data. The workflow included data preprocessing, feature engineering, training machine learning models, and deploying the solution via a Flask web application. The web app allows users to input various parameters and obtain immediate traffic predictions, showcasing the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios
